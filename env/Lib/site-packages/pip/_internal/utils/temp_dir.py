    This class can be used as a context manager or as an OO representation of a
    temporary directory.

    Attributes:
        path
            Location to the created temporary directory or None
        delete
            Whether the directory should be deleted when exiting
            (when used as a contextmanager)

    Methods:
        create()
            Creates a temporary directory and stores its path in the path
            attribute.
        cleanup()
            Deletes the temporary directory and sets path attribute to None

    When used as a context manager, a temporary directory is created on
    entering the context and, if the delete attribute is True, on exiting the
    context the created directory is deleted.
